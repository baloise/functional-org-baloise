The round trip is long (10 min), running locally does not help with integration / infrastructure problems
Documentation is sparse and forums (stack overflow ) out dated
Use Typed APIs for GraphQL
Monitoring / logging is far from real time
Strange exception handling / retry logic
Debugging with mvn azure-functions:run -> slow start up & could get code hot swap to work
There are no standards

Open points
Use terraform?
Use spring web?
